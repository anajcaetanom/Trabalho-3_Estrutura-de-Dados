# 🏥 Medical Examination Control - Logging Implementation

This project extends the previous one (**Medical Examination Control Simulation in C**) by implementing logging functionality to track key events. The project is structured into multiple files:

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`tp3.h`**: Contains the declarations of data structures and functions used in the project.
- **`tp3.c`**: Implements the functions defined in `tp3.h`.
- **`main.c`**: The main program that utilizes the implemented functions to log key events into the `log.txt` file.
- **`Makefile`**: Automates the compilation process.

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

1. Place the `Makefile` in the same directory as the source files.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run the following command to compile the program:
   ```sh
   make
   ```
4. Execute the program:
   ```sh
   ./tp3
   ```

## 💡 Implementation Decisions

This project introduces minor modifications to **Project 2** for better code organization and functionality. The main improvement is the addition of a logging mechanism to record important events.
